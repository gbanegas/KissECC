# Kiss ECC => Keep It Simple Stupid ECC #
In fact, it is a toy example to work with ECC.
You will find everything organized in classes and try to understand how to work
and how it works.

## Toy example for ECC ##

It is a toy example with some code from:

* https://gist.github.com/bellbind/1414867
* https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/software.html

## This work: ##
* It is not fast
* It is not secure
* You should never use in "real" applications

## What you should do: ##

If you are interested in a way to see the code working or if you want to learn with small examples.
